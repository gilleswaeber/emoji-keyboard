How to use
----------
Install [Autohotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) and then launch App.ahk. It will then stay in system tray until you call it.

You can open it either by pressing the left Alt key twice or by a double click on the tray icon.
You can hide it either by pressing the left Alt key, by closing it or by a double click on the tray icon.

Use the shown keyboard keys to navigate between the categories and type the Emojis. You can also use the mouse. You can move the window and resize it as you wish. If you use another keymap, pay only attention to the position of the different keys.

To exit completely, do a right click on the tray icon and choose Exit.

You can save your preferred size in the webapp.json file. Just change the values next to width and height.
