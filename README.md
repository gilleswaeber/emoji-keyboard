You can also open it by a double click on the tray icon.

Use the shown keyboard keys to navigate between the categories and type the Emojis. You can also use the mouse. You can move the window and resize it as you wish. If you use another keymap, pay only attention to the position of the different keys.

To exit completely, do a right click on the tray icon and choose Exit.

There are different available themes. Currently there is the default "light" theme and a "dark" theme similar to the Windows 10 touch keyboard.
